# Tooling and Scripts

_(Rule Type: Always)_

- This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager.
- Always use `pnpm` for installing, running, or updating packages.
- Do not use `npm` or `yarn` commands.
- Examples:
  - ✅ `pnpm install`
  - ✅ `pnpm run dev`
  - ✅ `pnpm add @testing-library/react`
  - ❌ `npm install`, ❌ `yarn add`

> ⚠️ All documentation, scripts, and generated code must reflect pnpm usage.
