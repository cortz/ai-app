# Tooling and Scripts

_(Rule Type: Always)_

Defines the standard tooling setup and usage rules for this project.

## Package Manager

- Use **pnpm** exclusively for installing and managing dependencies.
- Do **not** use `npm` or `yarn` under any circumstances.
- All scripts, documentation, and generated code must reflect `pnpm` usage.

### Examples

- ✅ `pnpm install`
- ✅ `pnpm run dev`
- ✅ `pnpm add @testing-library/react`
- ❌ `npm install`  
- ❌ `yarn add`

> ⚠️ Inconsistent tooling causes friction. Always align with the defined ecosystem.
