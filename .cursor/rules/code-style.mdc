# Code Style and Patterns

- Follow TypeScript best practices.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for variables and functions
- Structure conventions:
  - Follow existing folder and file organization patterns
- Create semantically correct components with clear boundaries:
  - Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose.
  - Separate UI elements with different responsibilities (e.g., navigation vs. data manipulation).
  - Avoid mixing unrelated functionality (e.g., donâ€™t place action buttons inside breadcrumb components).
- Maintain consistent formatting.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Throw errors sparingly. Error messages should end with a period.
- Use TanStack Query for all API interactions.
