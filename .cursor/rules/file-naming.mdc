# File and Naming Conventions

_(Rule Type: File Creation Only)_

- Component filenames **must use PascalCase**.  
  ✅ `Checkbox.tsx`, `UserCard.tsx`  
  ❌ `checkbox.tsx`, `user-card.tsx`
- The filename must match the exported component name exactly.
- Use PascalCase for component exports (e.g., `export const UserCard = () => {}`).
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Avoid default exports — always use named exports.
- Folders can use lowercase unless otherwise standardized in the project.
