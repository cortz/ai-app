# File and Naming Conventions

_(Rule Type: File Creation Only)_

## File Naming

- Component filenames **must use PascalCase**  
  ✅ `Checkbox.tsx`, `UserCard.tsx`  
  ❌ `checkbox.tsx`, `user-card.tsx`
- Filenames must match the name of their primary exported component exactly.
- Test files must follow the pattern: `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
- Use `.d.ts` for type definition files.
- Always prefer **named exports** over default exports for better traceability and auto-import support.

## Folder Organization

- Feature folders must use **kebab-case**  
  ✅ `user-profile/`, `auth-forms/`  
  ❌ `UserProfile/`, `authForms/`
- UI component folders must use **lowercase**  
  ✅ `components/ui/button/`  
  ❌ `components/UI/Button/`

### Project Structure

- `components/ui/`: Reusable, presentational UI components  
- `components/features/`: Feature-specific components scoped to domain logic  
- `lib/`: Shared utilities, helpers, and custom hooks  
- `types/`: Global TypeScript definitions
