# AI Rule Files Overview

This project uses modular `.mdc` files to define key conventions and standards. Each file has a specific focus to keep guidelines clear and maintainable.

## ðŸ”§ Core Rules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `code-style.mdc` | TypeScript conventions, formatting standards, and general coding practices |
| `file-naming.mdc` | File and folder naming conventions, project structure |
| `component-organization.mdc` | Component composition and separation of concerns |
| `form-validation.mdc` | Form handling patterns using react-hook-form and zod |
| `testing.mdc` | Testing standards for components using Vitest and React Testing Library |
| `tooling.mdc` | Package management (pnpm) and development tooling requirements |
| `pull-request.mdc` | Standards for writing clear pull request descriptions |

## âœ¨ Usage

- Reference these files before generating or reviewing code
- Keep all `.mdc` files in the `/rules` directory
- Contact the frontend team lead for questions about these standards
