# AI Rule Files Overview

This project uses modular `.mdc` files to define frontend conventions. Each file focuses on a specific area to ensure clarity, scalability, and ease of automation.

|------|---------|
| `code-style.mdc` | TypeScript conventions, formatting rules, and naming practices |
| `file-naming.mdc` | Standards for file/folder naming and project structure |
| `component-organization.mdc` | Guidelines for organizing and composing React components |
| `form-validation.mdc` | Patterns for validating forms using `react-hook-form` and `zod` |
| `testing.mdc` | Standards for writing tests with Vitest and React Testing Library |
| `tooling.mdc` | Requirements for dev tools, package managers, and CLI usage |
| `pull-request.mdc` | Conventions for writing pull request titles and descriptions |

## âœ¨ How to Use

- Review relevant `.mdc` files before creating, reviewing, or committing code
- All rule files are located in the `/rules` directory
