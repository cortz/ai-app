# AI App

This is an experimental project focused on exploring the capabilities of AI-assisted development. The primary goal is to leverage artificial intelligence tools to generate and maintain as much of the codebase as possible, serving as a testbed for AI-driven development practices.

## Project Goals

- Maximize the use of AI for code generation and maintenance
- Explore the boundaries of AI-assisted development
- Document best practices and limitations discovered during development
- Demonstrate practical applications of AI in real-world development scenarios

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added here.

## Development

This project follows specific conventions for pull requests and code contributions. Please refer to `.ai-rules/pull-request.md` for detailed guidelines.

### AI Development Guidelines

The project uses various AI tools and assistants for development. When contributing:

- Prefer AI-generated solutions when possible
- Document any limitations or challenges encountered with AI-generated code
- Follow the established code style and organization rules defined in our `.cursor/rules` directory
